- In this session, I will test transitivity of virtual network peering by using Network Watcher.
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select Network Watcher.

2. On the Network Watcher blade, expand the listing of Azure regions and verify the service is enabled in region you are using.

3. On the Network Watcher blade, navigate to the Connection troubleshoot.
4.  On the Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot blade, initiate a check with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

5. Click Run diagnostic tests and wait until results of the connectivity check are returned. Verify that the status is Success. Review the network path and note that the connection was direct, with no intermediate hops in between the VMs.

* two spoke virtual networks are not peered with each other (virtual network peering is not transitive).
