# Testing managing network traffic targeting Azure virtual machines in the hub and spoke network topology, considers implementing in its Azure environment (instead of creating the mesh topology). This testing needs to include implementing connectivity between spokes by relying on user defined routes that force traffic to flow via the hub, as well as traffic distribution across virtual machines by using layer 4 and layer 7 load balancers. For this purpose, you intend to use Azure Load Balancer (layer 4) and Azure Application Gateway (layer 7).
