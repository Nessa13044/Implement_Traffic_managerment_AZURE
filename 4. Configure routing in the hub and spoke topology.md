- configure and test routing between the two spoke virtual networks by enabling IP forwarding on the network interface of the az104-06-vm0 virtual machine, enabling routing within its operating system, and configuring user-defined routes on the spoke virtual network.
1. In the Azure portal, search and select Virtual machines.

2. On the Virtual machines blade, in the list of virtual machines, click az104-06-vm0.

3. On the az104-06-vm0 virtual machine blade, in the Settings section, click Networking.

4. Click the az104-06-nic0 link next to the Network interface label, and then, on the az104-06-nic0 network interface blade, in the Settings section, click IP configurations.

5. set ip forwarding enable and save the change.

* This setting is required in order for az104-06-vm0 to function as a router, which will route traffic between two spoke virtual networks.
* Now you need to configure operating system of the az104-06-vm0 virtual machine to support routing.

6. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the az104-06-vm0 Azure virtual machine blade and click Overview.

7. On the az104-06-vm0 blade, in the Operations section, click Run command, and, in the list of commands, click RunPowerShellScript.
8. On the Run Command Script blade, type the following and click Run to install the Remote Access Windows Server role.

# Now you need to create and configure user defined routes on the spoke virtual networks.

10. In the Azure portal, search and select Route tables and, on the Route tables blade, click + Create.
11. Create a route table with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

12. go to resources, On the az104-06-rt23 route table blade, in the Settings section, click Routes, and then click + Add.
-  route with the following settings:

13. Back on the az104-06-rt23 ( vnet2 to vnet 3 ) route table blade, in the Settings section, click Subnets, and then click + Associate. Associate the route table az104-06-rt23 with the following subnet:

14. Navigate back to Route tables blade and click + Create. Create a route table with the following settings (leave others with their default values):
- as above, create route table for az104-06-rt32 ( vnet3 to vnet 2 )

15. navigate back to the Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot blade. On the Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot blade, use the following settings (leave others with their default values):

* This is expected, since the traffic between spoke virtual networks is now routed via the virtual machine located in the hub virtual network, which functions as a router.
